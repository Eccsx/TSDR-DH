<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

For my end-of-studies internship as a computer science engineering student, I joined the [Astek Innovation Lab](https://astekgroup.fr/innovation/) in Paris (France) for a research subject about the detection and classification of traffic signs.

While searching and reading publications, I noticed two things. There are a lot of public datasets with multiples specifications and for different tasks. But no easy way to search through them and choose which one to use.

That's why I decided to create the repository, with the idea of offering a single place to display all the information related to traffic sign datasets.
